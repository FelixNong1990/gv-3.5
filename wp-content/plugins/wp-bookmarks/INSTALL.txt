Thanks for purchasing the WordPress User Bookmarks plugin.

1. Installation
==================

Please upload the installable plugin ZIP (wp-bookmarks.zip) to your WordPress plugins and activate it.

2. Usage
==================

To display the bookmark widget:

- You can use the sidebar widget (WordPress - Bookmark Widget)

- You can turn on automatic widget after post content in WP Bookmarks settings. Where you can exclude content, or certain post type(s)

- Shortcode method: [bookmark]

- API/PHP method: global $wpb; echo $wpb->bookmark();

To embed/display the user bookmarks/collections (for viewing/managing)

- Use this shortcode on the page you need (profile page, or any other page)

[collections]

- API method: global $wpb; echo $wpb->bookmarks();

3. Customize CSS
==================

- All css rules are in two css files inside /css/ folder

* wp-bookmarks.css (for the bookmark widget)
* wp-collections.css (for the collections shortcode)

4. Manage options
==================

All settings can be customized under WP Bookmarks dashboard panel.

Besides global settings, there are also "shortcode" options available for the [bookmark] shortcode. They OVERRIDE your global settings.
